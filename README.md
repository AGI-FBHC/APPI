Source code for paper AttPreSite: an efficient and fast protein-protein interaction site predictor based on dual-dimensional attention mechanism

The features of DNA and RNA are too large, you can use [GraphBind](http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/GraphBind/sourcecode.html) to generate the features of DNA and RNA

We provide tables of hyperparameter selection for three training sets (Train_335-1, DNA-Train_573, RNA-Train_495) in the appendix of the paper.
