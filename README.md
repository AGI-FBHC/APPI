## Introduction
(a) Input a protein's 3D structure and its amino acid sequence. Extract sequence information and structural information.    
(b) Construct a directed weighted graph, where each node represents a residue, each edge represents the connection between nodes, and the weight indicates the strength of the connection.  
(c) Apply a channel attention mechanism to assign attention weights to features propagated from different layers (hop distances). The SE-Aggregation (Squeeze-and-Excitation) module is used to aggregate neighbor information across different hops and learn their corresponding importance weights ùë§1,ùë§2,...,ùë§8, which are then combined through a weighted sum.  
(d) Employ a graph convolutional neural network (GCN) with the incorporation of Initial Residual Connections and Identity Mapping.  
(e) Overall Workflow of MAPPIS
